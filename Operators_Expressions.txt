ğŸ”¹ What are Operators in Python?

Operators are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on variables and values.

ğŸ”¹ Types of Operators in Python

Operator Type	Description	Example

Arithmetic	Basic math operations	+, -, *, /, %, //, **
Comparison	Compare two values	==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
Logical	Combine conditional statements	and, or, not
Assignment	Assign values to variables	=, +=, -=, *=
Bitwise	Operate on bits	`&,
Membership	Check for membership in a sequence	in, not in
Identity	Compare object identities	is, is not

ğŸ”¹ What are Expressions?
An expression is a combination of variables, operators, and values that evaluates to a single value.

ğŸ“Œ Example:

a = 10
b = 5
result = a + b  # Expression: a + b

ğŸ”¹ Examples

1. Arithmetic Operator
a = 10
b = 3
print(a + b)     # 13
print(a ** b)    # 1000 (10^3)

2. Comparison Operator
x = 5
y = 10
print(x > y)     # False
print(x != y)    # True

3. Logical Operator
x = 10
print(x > 5 and x < 20)   # True

4. Assignment Operator
x = 10
x += 5    # x = x + 5
print(x)  # 15

5. Membership Operator
fruits = ['apple', 'banana']
print('apple' in fruits)     # True
print('grape' not in fruits) # True
